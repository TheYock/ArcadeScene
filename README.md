# This repository contains my final project for CS 330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization. The submission includes:

- 3D Scene ZIP Folder – Contains the OpenGL-based 3D scene files.
- Design Decisions Document – Explains the rationale behind various design choices.
- Reflection on My Approach and Learning
- How do I approach designing software?
- When designing software, I start with defining the problem statement and requirements. For this project, I outlined key elements that the scene should include, such as an arcade machine, lighting effects, and textures. I then broke down the implementation into stages: setting up the scene, applying shaders, adding lighting, and refining textures. Using an iterative process allowed me to progressively improve the design while maintaining flexibility for changes.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me refine my 3D scene structuring skills by considering object positioning, scene hierarchy, and lighting interactions. Additionally, I developed a stronger understanding of shader programming in OpenGL, which enhances realism in computational graphics. Learning how to balance performance and aesthetics was another key takeaway, as real-time rendering efficiency is critical in computer graphics applications.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
- Conceptualization: Outlined the scene elements and lighting setup.
- Prototyping: Created basic geometric objects and tested transformations.
- Implementation: Applied shaders, textures, and refined the scene’s visual quality.
- Optimization: Tweaked lighting and shader parameters for better rendering performance.
- Testing & Iteration: Adjusted object placements, camera angles, and interactions to enhance realism.
  
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The structured and iterative approach I followed can be applied to future projects in graphics programming, game development, or software engineering. Breaking a problem into manageable components and continuously refining them ensures a high-quality outcome. Moreover, focusing on performance optimizations and scalability will be beneficial for any real-time system development.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I follow a modular development approach where I build individual components separately and then integrate them into the final system. For the 3D scene, I developed vertex and fragment shaders, lighting models, and texture mapping as separate modules before assembling them into a coherent scene.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- Shader-based rendering: Learned how to implement Phong lighting, texture mapping, and specular highlights using GLSL shaders.
- Hierarchical transformations: Applied model-view transformations to structure objects within the scene effectively.
- Debugging graphical issues: Used wireframe mode, normal visualization, and logging to identify rendering errors.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential in refining the project. After each milestone, I reviewed the rendering results and adjusted lighting, textures, and camera positioning accordingly. I also tested different shader configurations to achieve a more visually appealing and performance-efficient result.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Initially, my focus was on getting objects to render correctly. As the project progressed, I shifted towards improving scene realism with better shading and optimized rendering. I also became more comfortable working with OpenGL’s pipeline and buffer management, which will be valuable in future graphics projects.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science allows me to create immersive, interactive applications that merge creativity with problem-solving. My experience with computational graphics will be useful in game development, simulation, and visualization tasks, helping me build applications that blend art and technology.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This project expanded my understanding of real-time rendering, 3D transformations, and shader programming, which will be crucial in advanced graphics courses or research involving visual computing. It also reinforced my knowledge of linear algebra and matrix operations, which are fundamental in many CS fields.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The ability to create interactive visual experiences is valuable in multiple industries, including game development, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and simulation software. This project improved my ability to write efficient rendering code, structure graphical scenes, and debug rendering artifacts—skills that are highly relevant in professional software engineering roles.

This project serves as a key portfolio piece, demonstrating my ability to develop a fully realized 3D scene using OpenGL. It highlights my skills in software design, graphics programming, and iterative development, showcasing my capability to handle real-world computational graphics challenges.
